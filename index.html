    <p>In today's world, <b>knowledge</b> can often feel like a heavy weight,
    revealing truths that are uncomfortable and sometimes overwhelming. You disover that the more they know, the more you realise how little control you truly have
    , making awareness almost <i>exhausting</i>. Meanwhile others live in 
    a state of <b>ignorance</b>, untouched by the stress of global issues, digital overload, and constant information.
    In a strange way, this creates a constrast where <b>knowledge</b> becomes a burden while <i>ignorance</i> appears blissful, offering a simple escape from the chaos of modern life like this dog below.</p>
